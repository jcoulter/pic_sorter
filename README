pic_sorter is a simple util that will sort my photos based on the EXIF meta-data.

Place your jpegs in the staging directory and run "ruby pic_loader.rb".

It will create a folder for the year and a subfolder for the month associated with the date the photo was taken.

Duplicate file names will have a "z" prepended. 

e.g. 

2010/6/myPhoto.jpg
2010/6/zmyPhoto.jpg
